She is co-founder of Bay Area Covid Tutoring and helps manage daily operations for the organization. Living in Silicon Valley, Emma understood the importance of technology, especially during the pandemic. After working with RRRcomputer, an organization that refurbishes used computers and donates them to public schools, Emma wanted to find a way to provide some aid to students online when going to school in person is difficult. Outside of school, Emma enjoys Model UN conferences, playing tennis and skiing, and being the layout editor to Miltonâ€™s primary newsletter. Emma hopes that BACT will make an amazing impact on all tutors and tutees just as volunteering in Boston has done for her.</p>

                        <p class = "BACTbio">Harrison Le is a high school junior attending Summit Shasta High School in Daly City, California. During the Fall of 2020, he studied at the School for Ethics and Global Leadership in Washington D.C, a semester-long residential program with a unique curriculum emphasizing ethical thinking skills, leadership development, and international affairs. As a Co-Founder at Bay-area  COVID-tutoring (BACT), Harrison heads day-to-day operations along with his partner, Emma Tung. These operations consist of the development of ideas, objectives, special projects while overseeing the BACT leadership team. As an expansion of Boston Covid-Tutoring (BCT), Harrison hopes to bring the same amount of passion and dedication to his work as did the senior leadership team at BCT. Due to the increase in economic and educational inequalities caused by this pandemic, Harrison wanted to contribute to his community. Inspired by the stories of his peers and family, his goal is to provide a meaningful educational experience while assisting promising students to become independent, confident, and passionate thinkers. Harrison hopes to make a positive impact and provide an education every student should have access to regardless of their socioeconomic status or background. </p>

Having lived in Silicon Valley all her life and attending schools in multiple counties across the Bay, she knows the partner schools, community, and people well. Katie is an avid tennis player, runner, and horseback rider. She looks forward to making a difference in her area by giving students an opportunity for educational development, and hopes that other high school students will find the same joy through partnering with BACT.</p>
