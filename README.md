# Boston Covid Tutoring Website


## Introduction

[Boston Covid Tutoring](https://bostoncovidtutoring.org/) is a free tutoring service for young students in the Boston area. This repo is dedicated to BCT's [website](https://bostoncovidtutoring.org/).

## Contributing

If you are thinking about contributing to the website, thank you for trying to help!

Here's what you need to know to get started

- Only push to the development branch
- Pushing (or merging) to master will trigger a Github action that **automatically publishes the website**
	- So please never do this unless your code has been reviewed and approved.
- We have created a [template](https://github.com/dphiggins/BCT-website/blob/master/public/assets/template.html) for our webpages. Use this to get started easily.
- Development is hosted on Github Pages through https://dphiggins.github.io/BCT-website/public/. The default link doesn't work since the root directory can't be set to "/public".

Below are a list of features we still need to add, in order of importance. Please feel free to get started on any open features.
